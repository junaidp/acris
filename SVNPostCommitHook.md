# Intructions #

We are using free deployment environment for Java application provided by Google App engine on acris-gwt.appspot.com. If you are acris developer just commit your changes and email notification will be delivered to you.

If you want to set-up SVN mail notifications on your own, follow the next steps:
  * install GEP and GAE (instalation guide is here: http://code.google.com/intl/sk-SK/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/installing.html)
  * download sources from
`https://acris.googlecode.com/svn/branches/svn-post-commit`
  * generate eclipse project using maven (command: mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse)
  * copy project dependencies to the war/WEB-INF/lib directory (command: dependency:copy-dependencies)
  * import your project into the eclipse workspace
  * create settings.properties (you can use example settings file settings.properties\_example)
    * from property - SVN notification emails sender (have to be validated google account email address added to the App Engine project environment)
    * to property - SVN notification emails recepients
    * authentication - enter your Post-Commit Authentication Key generated by google

# Running and deploying project #
