# Prepare maven #

As of AcrIS 1.0.1 version deployment of artifacts consists of two repositories:
  * Sonatype OSS free repository (Maven release)
  * Googlecode's SVN based one (Manual release)

Because we don't want to polute SVN history too much and because SVN is not the right maven repository management we migrated artifacts to Sonatype's. As of version 1.0.1 all AcrIS related artifacts (AcrIS, SeSAM, CorpIS) will reside in Sonatype's. Other artifacts we built for our purposes (external libraries) will remain in Googlecode's as their release is not made that often. In the future all artifacts will be at Sonatype and synced to Maven Central.

## Step 0 ##

There are two ways:
  * use prepared keystore with Sonatype & Sourceforge certificates -> in this case go to step 3
  * install key(s) manually -> maybe this is the case if you already have keystore for maven

## Step 1 ##

Download Sonatype into your PC. For every downloaded certificate execute following guide below. Name the certificate file e.g. **sonatype.pem**.

## Step 2 ##

Following command will import the certificate and asks for a password used to authorize the access to the keystore (and for our example we will use: **keystorePassword**):

  * `keytool -v -alias sonatype -import -file sonatype.pem -keystore trust.jceks -storetype jceks`

This will create **trust.jceks** on your filesystem. Place it whereever you can find it because it will be needed by Maven!

Delete the certificate file because it will not be needed anymore. The authorization process will be executed against your keystore.

We will follow with 3rd step - setting MAVEN\_OPTS up. There are several ways how to do it but these three parameters of Java VM needs to be in place:

  * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/trust.jceks
  * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword
  * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks

## Step 3 ##

How to setup MAVEN\_OPTS:
  * in case of using prepared keystore use path to acris-os-parent/acris.jceks file
  * for the environment of the operating system (the preferred way):
    * in **Windows**: Start -> Control panel -> System -> Environment variables, put new key MAVEN\_OPTS following values -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=c:\path\to\keystore\acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks
    * in **Linux**: in your home directory create file **.mavenrc** and put htere following value MAVEN\_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks

  * or you can set environment variable for specific case/terminal/environment:
    * in Windows console set MAVEN\_OPTS=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=c:\path\to\keystore\acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks
    * almost the same in Linux using export MAVEN\_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks"
    * or using direct maven command with variable in Linux: MAVEN\_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks" mvn compile

## Step 4 ##

Final step is to setup authentification information for SVN access. Open your **settings.xml** in ".m2" directory and enter following information to the **servers** section:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
			<username>sonatypes-jira-user</username>
			<password>sonatypes-jira-pass</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
			<username>sonatypes-jira-user</username>
			<password>sonatypes-jira-pass</password>
		</server>

		<server>
			<id>acris-snapshots-repo</id>
			<username>darth</username>
			<password>tater</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>acris-releases-repo</id>
			<username>darth</username>
			<password>tater</password>
		</server>
	</servers>

</settings>
```

The password for Googlecode repository is generated by google and you can find it in "Source" tab and clicking the "google password" link.

You can obtain a password for Sonatype repository by registering at: https://issues.sonatype.org

# Snapshots deployment #

Execute **mvn deploy** optionally with -Dmaven.test.skip in project you want to deploy to snapshots repository. Execute it on parent project if you want to deploy all projects.

# Release #

To deploy to Sonatype (and later to be compliant with Maven central) artifacts need to be signed. Follow the guide on how to create a PGP key and use it with Maven GPG plugin - http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/

The process of deployment follows the guide at http://axelfontaine.com/blog/final-nail.html

## Steps ##

  * `git clone` or `git pull`
  * check the pom whether there are comments to follow - e.g. changing a version
  * go through all dependency versions and resolve all SNAPSHOT versions
  * `mvn versions:set`
  * `mvn -DperformRelease -DskipTests -Dgpg.passphrase=SecretGPG clean javadoc:jar deploy`
  * close the release (see chapter below)
    * verify the release is closed
  * `mvn versions:commit`
  * `git commit -a`
  * `git push`
  * `mvn scm:tag`
  * increase the development version number
    * `mvn versions:set`
    * `mvn versions:commit`
    * `git commit -a`
    * `git push`

Go through the base projects first and then release from parent projects (sesam-os, corpis-os, acris-os). Build projects (in the root) should not be used for releasing.

## Close the release ##

  * Log in to https://oss.sonatype.org/
  * select appropriate groupId in Staging repositories
  * select staging release and Close it


## When you forget to include a module into the release ##

  * e.g. it is not in parent pom
  * go to the tagged source tree, e.g. target/checkout directly to the module you want to release again, or download a tag
  * mvn source:jar javadoc:jar gpg:sign repository:bundle-create
  * use Sonatype console - Staging Upload - where you upload the bundle

## Post release/deploy steps ##

  * export artifacts as a ZIP bundle to download section with a script in **sesam-helper-scripts** - ExportMavenDeps.py (there is README as well)
  * prepare release notes
  * move old release notes to OldReleaseNotes
  * adjust release dates table
  * close issues and mark them correctly
